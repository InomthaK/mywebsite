You’re not expected to watch all the seasons to understand this post, but I would still recommend it, to really understand the impact a well written story can have. </p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/771d1e_1586bd6e8ce54435b0552f2df15c1390~mv2.jpg" data-size="1000x563"><img loading="lazy" src="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/771d1e_1586bd6e8ce54435b0552f2df15c1390~mv2-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405"></a></figure></div></div><p> </p><p>Bob-Walksberg and his colleagues have made sure that the mental illness’ being depicted in the show are realistic and relatable. I believe that this show, for a lot of reasons, is the best way to learn about mental illness’ in the real-world setting. Of course, you might need a bit of academic background to grasp the different themes discussed in the show. But still, this gives out more practical information on certain mental disorders like depression and addiction than any textbooks I have ever read. And it's not just the one protagonist that showcase the symptoms of mental disorders, and everyone else tries to either ease his pain or inflict more. Rather almost all the characters in the show appear to have some mental disorders- however happy they seem (spoiler alert!).</p><h2 class="align-center">BOJACK - MAIN CHARACTER</h2><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/wp2084711.png" data-size="1920x1080"><img loading="lazy" src="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/wp2084711-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="405"></a></figure></div></div><p>Bojack is depressed, yes, but he doesn’t go about weeping in the corner of his bedroom. Rather he opts other ways to deal with his sadness and anxiety, like using drugs and acting out. From afar, Bojack seems like just the opposite of depression. Bojack also showcases narcissistic qualities, which when added with depression is a very deadly combination. Even though he doesn’t proclaim it aloud, Bojack believes himself to be unique in the sense that he is the only sad person in the world- which is exactly how a depressed person might think. He acts out to win the praise of others because no matter what he does, he just can’t seem to think that he is good enough. So he turns to external sources for appreciation.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/ipc4fiyabu171.webp" data-size="1413x827"><img loading="lazy" src="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/ipc4fiyabu171-thumbnail.webp" alt="" width="720" height="421"></a></figure></div></div><p>The show isn’t a mere portrayal of these conditions but it also attempts to explore the root causes of these mental disorders. According to Jeff Young, one of the most notable figures in the field of schema therapy, these thought patterns develop throughout childhood to adolescence. The show often plays flashback scenes of characters involving the emotionally abusive father or insensitive mother or peer pressure, throwing light into how these schemas came into existence. Bojack trusts no male companions as his father always criticised him and considered him a burden. And he believed that females lacked emotions because of his insensitive mother. So, whichever relations he gets into, he tries to sabotage it on his own. Either he didn’t want to feel the pain of separation or betrayal or he thought that he didn’t deserve any happiness that came along with such relationships.</p><h2 class="align-center">DIALOGUE</h2><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/bojack-2.webp" data-size="570x321"><img loading="lazy" src="https://Inomthak.github.io/mywebsite/media/posts/2/gallery/bojack-2-thumbnail.webp" alt="" width="570" height="321"></a></figure></div></div><p id="6adb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oh oi ja oj b ok ol om on oo op oq or hb os ot ou he ov ow ox hh oy oz pa pb ib bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">I’d like to end this article with some of the most depressing dialogues from the series, which accurately reflects the thinking of a person who is actually depressed;</p><p id="8212" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oh oi ja oj b ok ol om on oo op oq or hb os ot ou he ov ow ox hh oy oz pa pb ib bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">“I need to go take a shower so I can’t tell if I’m crying or not”</p><p id="9ae9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oh oi ja oj b ok ol om on oo op oq or hb os ot ou he ov ow ox hh oy oz pa pb ib bl" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Sometimes I think I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me and now it’s all gone.
